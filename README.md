# iot-config-checklist
Checklist to use when configuring the "communication stack" for an IoT device.


## Why a checklist?

Establishing reliable communcations between devices and the cloud or service they are supposed to talk to is key to any IoT application. This being said, the complexity of the networking stack and protocols involved sometimes make it difficult to understand what's going on "on the wire" when messages are lost, dropped, throttled, etc. This set of checklists will hopefully help you figure out what parameters you can tweak to get the most reliability out of your network.
